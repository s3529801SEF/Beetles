	<span> IT: Interest </span>
	<span> IT: Court and Spark </span>
	<p> First install of Ubuntu and seeing
	  the source code to the OS inner
	  workings. The arcane impression of
	  Emacs goat and an elisp tutorial.
	  Reading the GNU's manifesto
	  by Stallman. Software should be
	  "free". The negative influence of
	  panopticon family units and
	  community.

      <div> <span> IT: Wisdom </span>
	<ul><li>experimental, troll sites
	    development,
	    clear-net and ahh.. unclear.</li>
	  <li> to do list app implemented with
	    simple js, css/html and a touch of
	    php, paprika and lime.
	  </li>
	  <li> A trivial, buggy, chat site
	    (without sockets)
	    implemented in php and js with
	    sleep() and triggers refresh on
	    page load. CopyLeft. All credit to
	    me.
	  </li>
	  <li> some experiments and small class
	    assignments with emacs lisp.</li>
	  <li> and so on.     </li>

			<div> <span> Why:RMIT? </span>
		<p>	 I finished mature-age, foundational studies
			 at UON, online, with a focus on business and was considering a related degree, elsewhere. <br>
 However, the IT course at RMIT seemed accessible and interesting, and I
 was offered a place in the early round. Moreover, the application to 
RMIT 
mentioned my interest and experience with art and music composition. So,
 I feel this part of me was welcomed by such an offer.

	<div> <span> Expectation:Studies </span>
	<p>...have been enrolled long enough now to 
		have learned at least the basics of programming, web development and first year 
		statistics. <br>What I hope to learn however, are the skills and 
mindset neccessary to 
		develop and refine a well-structured and
		thorough, academic response. Although, at the same time, perhaps I 
feel the expecations of industry  (including) and the academy, may in 
fact, promote a steralizing of creative dissent. Thus, my expectations 
are mixed.
	However, this is not to say I lack faith entirely. I sense the 
potential for effective trajectories, such as could only be fostered by a
 highly sturctured environment and a good understanding of the 
implications of IT.
